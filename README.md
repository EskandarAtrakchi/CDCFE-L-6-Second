# Introduction

In this document I will walk, step-by-step, from the beginning; building a vehicle system using SQL code in the back end and the code will be provided in this document, the system will be able to view all the available vehicles that are ready to be sold to small and large organizations, both global (English speakers) and local, in the public and private sectors.

The database will allow employees to manage invoices, customer details, and vehicles.

&#x20;

Users will be able to create an account and buy any vehicles they want, the HLD is described below. Furthermore, to break it into smaller components, 10 clear points of LLDs have been created to give a better representation of what the system will do. Data modelling is important to know what fields are required to satisfy each LLD. This document treats the LLDs in a very careful manner since they considered the backbone of customer satisfaction. &#x20;

&#x20;

In this document I will also provide an overview of the process of the normalization. I will make sure that the data has been stored only once in the database. This document describes a database with four tables (Invoices, Vehicles, Users, Cards)

&#x20;

Screenshots of the ERD was taken to give a visual representation of the tables and also the data dictionary is included in this document to ensure that the

&#x20;

The SQL code later is written and tested. SQL code will be written to see if the code is working and to clarify the statements that I will use in the vehicle system. Structured Query Language (SQL) is a standard language used to manage relational databases.

The document then will list the design interface of the system to show how the LLDs have been satisfied.
